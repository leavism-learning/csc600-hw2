# HW2

This was homework for CSC600 Programming Paradigms. The objective for this assignment was to practice writing pure functions, using sum datatypes, and tuples.

- `hw2.ts` contains hw2.
- Your code needs to compile with no errors with
  ```
  tsc --strict --target es2019 --module commonjs hw2.ts
  ```
  If your code does not compile, we will not grade your submission.
- You can run your compiled code with
  ```
  node hw2.js
  ```
